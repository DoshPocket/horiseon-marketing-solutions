# horiseon-marketing-solutions

## Description
Horiseon Marketing Solutions had a need to improve their web application codebase in order to adhere to accessibility standards and so that the site was optimized for SEO. 

I improved this code to benefit Horiseon and its users. It was also a perfect opportunity for me to put my knowledge of accessibility coding to work. 

Horiseon now has a web application that meets accessibility criteria and is optimized for SEO.

I learned that proper labelling of elements and descriptive img alts help to optimize SEO, how to cleanly consolidate classes with the same attributes and values, how to properly comment on a css document, how to create a high-quality README file, and a more robust understanding of git.
